The Linux Operating System is a type of operating system that is similar to Unix, and it is built upon the Linux Kernel. The Linux Kernel is like the brain of the operating system because it manages how the computer interacts with its hardware and resources. It makes sure everything works smoothly and efficiently. But the Linux Kernel alone is not enough to make a complete operating system. To create a full and functional system, the Linux Kernel is combined with a collection of software packages and utilities, which are together called Linux distributions. These distributions make the Linux Operating System ready for users to run their applications and perform tasks on their computers securely and effectively. Linux distributions come in different flavors, each tailored to suit the specific needs and preferences of users.

Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

It is used for:
* Tracking code changes
* Tracking who made changes
* Coding collaboration

## What does Git do?

* Manage projects with Repositories
* Clone a project to work on a local copy
* Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
* Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
* Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
* Push local updates to the main project

## Working with Git

* Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
* Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
* When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
* You select the modified files you want to Stage
* The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
* Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
* You can revert back to any previous commit.
* Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

## Why Git?

* Over 70% of developers use Git!
* Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
* Developers can see the full history of the project.
* Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.

What is GitHub?

* Git is not the same as GitHub.
* GitHub makes tools that use Git.
* GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
* In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
